# MIPS Simulator

The MIPS Simulator project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the MIPS datapath architecture. It accomplishes this goal through the development of a cycle-accurate instruction-level simulator that supports a subset of the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

## Key Objectives

- Gain insights into the design and functioning of the MIPS datapath.
- Develop a cycle-accurate simulator to model the behavior of MIPS instructions.
- Enable users to run MIPS programs and observe their outputs efficiently.

## Code Structure

All project details and explanations can be found in the `sim.c` file.
